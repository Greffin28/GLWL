# OpenGL Wrapper and Library
This library is about reinventing the wheel. If you're looking for the best OpenGL wrapper or library, you're in the wrong place. There are probably a lot of better library out there.

This is my custom library to ease myself using OpenGL. This library is based on GLEW library and use C++ as it's language.

Will add features here later.
